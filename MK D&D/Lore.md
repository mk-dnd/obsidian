## History 
- The Night of the Three Calamities.
	- The Evil Lych Daarkvard unleashed the Phantom Assassins to devour the royalty accross the land.
	- The Mad Mage Kibblecob fired a mountain destroying beam to level the Great Mountain Trevoltius. 
	- A massive Meteor crashed into the city of CITY
	- Well as it turns out. Lord Daarkvard was atop the mountain, and Kibblecob was in the city. So Daarkvard never had a chance to take over after destroying the all those with royal blood. Kibblecob only destroyed half the mountain. And the meteor was made of MINERAL which became a great source of wealth for the city.
